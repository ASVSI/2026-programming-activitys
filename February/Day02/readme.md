## 🛡️ 1. Set clear rules (your first line of defense)

Even a simple platform **needs terms**.

### Do this ASAP:

Create a page called **“Terms of Use”** or **“Community Rules”** and clearly say:

* Users **own the content they upload**
* Users are **responsible for what they post**
* No stolen art, copyrighted content, NSFW, hate, illegal stuff
* You can **remove content or ban users** at any time
* You are **not responsible for transactions** made via WhatsApp

This single sentence matters a LOT:

> “We act only as a listing platform and are not responsible for disputes, payments, or delivery between buyers and sellers.”

Even basic terms protect you.

---

## 👤 2. Control who can upload (don’t go fully open)

Avoid “anyone can upload instantly.”

### Safer options:

* ✅ **Email verification**
* ✅ **Manual approval** for first upload
* ✅ **Limit number of uploads** for new users
* ✅ **Admin review** before artwork goes public

This stops spam, stolen art, and abuse early.

---

## 🚨 3. Reporting & takedown system (VERY important)

Give users a way to report abuse.

Minimum setup:

* “🚩 Report this artwork” button
* Form options like:

  * Stolen artwork
  * Inappropriate content
  * Scam / fake artist

Then:

* You review
* You remove if needed
* You keep a record

This shows **good faith** if problems happen.

---

## 🖼️ 4. Protect against stolen artwork

You can’t fully stop it — but you can reduce risk.

### Easy protections:

* Ask artists to confirm:

  > “I confirm this artwork is original and owned by me.”
* Add **watermarks** automatically (optional)
* Show upload date + username publicly
* Limit bulk uploads

This shifts responsibility **onto the uploader**, not you.

---

## 💬 5. WhatsApp safety disclaimer

Since deals happen outside your platform:

Add a small note near the WhatsApp button:

> “Transactions and communication happen directly between buyer and artist. Please verify details before payment.”

This is HUGE for liability.

---

## 🔐 6. Admin tools you should have (even basic)

Make sure *you* can:

* Delete any artwork
* Suspend / ban users
* Block IPs or emails
* Edit listings if needed

If you don’t have control → you’re exposed.

---

## 📉 7. Limit your risk while you’re small

Early-stage = keep it light.

* Don’t store payments
* Don’t store sensitive data
* Don’t promise guarantees
* Don’t claim authenticity verification (unless you do it)

The less you handle, the less you’re responsible for.

---

## 🧠 8. Mental model to remember

Your platform is a:

> **Noticeboard + contact bridge**

Not a marketplace with escrow, delivery, or payment handling.

As long as your site reflects that clearly, **your risk stays low**.

---

## 🧾 Optional (but powerful)

If you want extra safety later:

* Register a basic business entity
* Use a custom domain + email
* Add Privacy Policy (even a template)

---

### TL;DR (bookmark this)

✔ Clear terms
✔ Upload control
✔ Report button
✔ Manual moderation
✔ WhatsApp disclaimer
✔ Admin powers

Do these, and you’re **way more protected than most early platforms**.

If you want, tell me:

* Which **no-code platform** you’re using
* Whether uploads are **manual or automatic**

I can give you **exact feature-by-feature steps** for your setup.
